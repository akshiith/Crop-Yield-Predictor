# Crop-Yield-Predictor
Krishi AI is a smart farming platform for Odisha farmers that combines AI-powered crop yield prediction with weather and soil analysis. It helps farmers optimize their harvests through personalized recommendations. The system uses FastAPI backend to process weather data (Open-Meteo API) and soil data (SoilGrids API).I have used react for frontend.
